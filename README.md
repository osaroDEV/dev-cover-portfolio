Devcover is an open source application which allows developers to create a portfolio in less than 2 minutes with just their **username**.

## Inspiration

I decided to do this project for 2 reasons, the first is that as a developer I know that in most cases we spend very little time creating our portfolio or we don't even have it, the second reason is that I like to participate in hackathons so I built this project for [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) hackathon two companies which I admire.

## Deploy your own Portfolio on Vercel

If you want to customize your portfolio colours, name, bio a put your Google Analytics code, I suggest you create your portfolio on [Devcover](https://devcover.me) website.

If you prefer to go faster and accept the default parameters you can click on the following button and the only thing you have to do is put your [Github](https://github.com) or [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) username in the **NEXT_PUBLIC_USERNAME**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
